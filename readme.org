- [X] Extract callgraph from simple function
- [X] Type definition
- [X] Multifile project analysis
- [X] Metaprogramming features - call generated by template

- [ ] Endgame test - analyze full source code for nim compiler
  - [ ] Show usage locations for all magics

- [ ] Documentation extractor-as-a-libary. Provide basic API for writing
  documentation extraction software.
- [ ] Use unit tests as use examples
- [ ] Extracting additional semantic information from [[https://github.com/haxscramper/haxorg][haxorg]] documentation
  comments (metadata information like ~@ingroup{}~ annotations,
  documentation for comments, fields and so on).
- [ ] User-defined higlighting logic (special side effects, exceptions that
  developer might want to make accent on)

** TODO Static site generator for documentation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CREATED:  <2021-01-13 Wed 15:14>
   :END:

- [ ] Basic implementation of simple documentation - no pretty
  configuration, can be just bare HTML
- [ ] Search implementation - can use fulltext search like [[https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch][flexsearch]] in
  addition to something closer to [[https://hoogle.haskell.org/][hoogle]] for API/error search.

** TODO Change detection for software versions
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CREATED:  <2021-01-13 Wed 15:14>
   :END:

- [ ] Automatic change detection for API/implementation
- [ ] Automatic changelog documentation
